#Observable Relational Data Service

This packages enables you to query local relational data easily. You can define models and its relations, and query them
with easy to write statements. The data can be queried either statically or as an observable. 

When queried as an 
observable, the observable will automatically refresh the data once you have changed any of its objects (models) through
any of the ords functions ( add(), update(), etc... ).
